    3) npx

    node tool, helps to execute the JavaScript

    npm stands for node packaging manager

    npm helps to install "ReactJS"

    npm used to download libraries

    npx stands for node packaging runner

    npx creates the environment to build react applications

website : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

file    : node-v16.16.0-x64.exe

2) install "create-react-app" tool

    "create-react-app" is the tool, used to create the react applications

    "create-react-app" tool is the command based installation

    > npm install --location=global create-react-app


3) install yarn tool

    yarn tool given by Facebook

    yarn tool used to download the libraries

    yarn tool installation is command based installation

    > npm install --location=global yarn


4) download and install Visual Studio Code

    Visual Studio Code IDE Provided by Microsoft

    Visual Studio Code IDE is Recomended IDE to build ReactJS Applications

    Visual Studio Code IDE given by microsoft and open source IDE


website : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win

file    : VSCodeUserSetup-x64-1.70.0.exe


creating first react application
********************************

1) create directory

    Ex.
            ReactJS_5AM


2) create react application with following command

    > npx create-react-app first-app

    where "first-app" is the react application

3) switch to react application

    > cd first-app

4) execute the react application

    > yarn start
         (or)
    > npm start

    Default Port Number of React Application is 3000


directory structure
*******************
node_modules containes libraries

these libraries helps to create and execute the react applications

public/index.html
    react starts the execution from index.html file

    index.html file behaves like "main" template

    index.html containes "div" whose id is "root"

src
***
    React Applications are Component Based Applications
    we can create More than one Component
    where "App" Component is the Default Component
    where "App.css" file is the style sheet for App Component
    where "App.test.js" file is the unit test case file for App Component

src/index.css
    index.css file used to define global styles

src/index.js
    it is used to register the components
    registration file will handover component to index.html file whose id is root

package.json
    it containes libraries information
